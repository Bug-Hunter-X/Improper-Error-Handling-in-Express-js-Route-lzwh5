# Improper Error Handling in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within route handlers. The `bug.js` file showcases a route that fetches user data from a database but fails to handle errors gracefully.  This leads to generic, unhelpful error messages for the client.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages to the client.
